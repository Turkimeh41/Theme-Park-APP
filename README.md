Project Name: Theme Park User Management and Cashless Payment System

Description: The Theme Park User Management and Cashless Payment System is a project aimed at providing a streamlined solution for managing users within a theme park environment.
 The system allows park visitors to recharge their accounts with money and make purchases using a cashless payment method.
 
 
 The core functionality includes user registration, account balance management, QR code scanning for seamless transactions, and transaction history tracking.
 By leveraging this system, theme parks can enhance the overall visitor experience, reduce cash handling, and improve operational efficiency.
